                                <li><b>Challenge:</b> Prior to July 2020, the 3D India team (Operations & Support) relied on manual processes and multiple tools (Excel, Quip, Data Extracts, Emails) to track and analyze KPIs for users, artists, leads, and
                                    managers. This resulted in high latency, decreased accuracy, and limited troubleshooting capabilities.</li>
                                <li><b>Solution:</b> Upon joining as a 3D Support Coordinator (MIS) in July 2020, I led the automation of the KPI reporting process. Leveraging SQL queries, stored procedures, events, advanced Excel formulas, and macros, I
                                    streamlined the workflow and re-structured reports for enhanced efficiency and accuracy. </li>

                                    <li>Developed custom automation scripts including 30 stored procedures and 20 events to handle various tasks and functionalities for the 3D India teams.</li>
